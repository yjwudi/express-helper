# express-helper
Express-helper is a web service application. It used to help people to get their expresses if they don't have time. The software contains three part: back-end database, android application<br>
The back-end database is developed by my friend Join Wei.
We used tomcat as server, with mysql database.<br>
The android application communicates with the back-end with soap and wsdl protocol.
